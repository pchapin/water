# Water

Waterfalls of the New England Region. This repository contains my waterfall website.

This repository makes use of Git LFS. Be sure you have Git LFS installed before you
clone this repository. If the command `git lfs version` returns an error about how
`lfs` is an unknown Git command, then you do *not* have Git LFS installed, and you
will need to address that.
