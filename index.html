<p>My name is Peter Chapin, and this is my page for waterfall enthusiasts. I focus on the
  waterfalls of New England and neighboring regions (such as New York and bordering Canada). I
  pursue waterfalls as a hobby and as an excuse to get outside and into the woods. It's also an
  opportunity for me to practice with photography and website design. Enjoy the site; I hope you
  find it interesting and useful.</p>
