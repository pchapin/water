    <p>I added a trip description for <a href="abbey.html">Abbey Pond Cascades</a>. This gave me
      an opportunity to get a fresh picture of the upper falls.</p>

    <p>I added a trip description for <a href="jefferson.html">Jefferson Falls</a>. This is a new
      waterfall for me. I visited the falls a month ago on August 6.</p>

    <p>I've started working on this site again. There is much to do! I plan to update resources
      and links, fix the text on several of the pages (typos, grammar, etc), promote site-wide
      consistency (better styles?), modernize the data presented (GPS coordinates, anyone?), add
      more pictures that I've had waiting in the wings for years, and, of course, start visiting
      waterfalls again.</p>

    <p>My plan is to dedicate a small amount of time to working on this site each day. I will
      start with 30 minutes/day and see how that goes. Day-to-day progress won't be spectacular,
      but it should add up over time. Back in the day when this site was doing well, that was the
      approach I used. I found it both enjoyable and effective.</p>

    <p>Stay tuned and visit again soon!</p>
